#Problem to solve

The script song_mix_loopback.py takes a list of songs and plays them in order with transitions at the best transition between the 2 songs.  If a transition to the next song begins at a later point in the song than the best transition from that song to its next, the song will loop back before the transition, and play up to the transition.

The scprit song_mix_stepback.py does the same thing as song_mix_loopback.py, except instead of looping back in the same song, a different transition will be taken in order to keep the flow of the music going.

#Inspiration

This is the final project for my class Music Informatics.  The final project will be a way to take a list of MP3 files and play them in order with logical transitions.  All the tools to do this have previously been written.  However, the problem at hand is dealing with a transition that begins later in a song than the next transition.  These 2 scripts attempt to solve this problem in the most optimal way.
