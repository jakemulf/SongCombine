#TODO: reorder_map()

"""
song_mix_loopback.py

Takes a list of songs, determines the transitions between all consecutive songs, 
and creates a single mp3 file with the given transitions and tempo changes between songs.

If one of the transitions is past the point of the next best transition, the song will
loop back to a point before the transition, and play from there.

The user can specify a transition ratio (how much of the song to look at) and a maximum
number of segments to change tempo.  For the ratio, the number should be between 0.0 and 1.0,
and the number given will be how much of the song to look at from the middle.  For example,
a ratio of 0.5 will look at the middle 1/2 of the song, 25% on each side from the middle.

Created by Jacob Mulford on 04/04/2015

Based on infinitejuke.com and https://github.com/echonest/remix/blob/master/examples/stretch/simple_stretch.py

Updated on 04/05/2015 to reoder the list of songs to make the transitions more ideal

Usage: song_mix_loopback.py [list of mp3 files] transition_ratio segment_tempo_change_limit output_file delay[t/f] compare_tempo[t/f] algorithm[p/k]

Example: song_mix_loopback.py YouCanCallMeAl.mp3 CallMeMaybe.mp3 Celebration.mp3 Beethoven5th.mp3 .5 20 mashup.mp3 t f p

This will take the 4 mp3 files, combine them all together using Prim's algorithm at the ideal transitions, and put this
combination into mashup.mp3.  Each song will have up to 20 segments to change tempo, and the middle
50% of each song will be looked at.  The program will delay slightly after each echonest call, and
tempo will not be used in the comparison
